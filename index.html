 <pre style="color:gray;text-align:center;">
  <i> i am going to try and make the text a decent size so those we have trouble with small text don't have to worry about it.
  i am also going to create a menu bar so that my website will be easily navigable and no one will be confused about what information is located where.
  i saw that a few other girls had boxes around their information which made it look super cool and had a very organized feel to it. as to how they did it, i am not too sure but i am excited to find out how later this week or at 
  another time in the near future. i am most proud of the fact that i got a website going and was able to add text and personalize it a bit. before class today
  i would have never thought that i would have accomplished so much in one day! </i>
